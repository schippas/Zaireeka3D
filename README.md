# Zaireeka3D
A Unity app to simulate spatial surround sound in a room environment.

# How to Run

This application should be able to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux, though it has only been tested on Windows. You can either download a compiled version from the release tab of this project, or clone the repository to run it inside the Unity editor.

It is required that you provide your own audio files for each audio source. You can do this by placing your audio files into the "Zaireeka3D_Data/Resources/Source #" folders. Only WAV and OGG files will work. If you have audio files you want to play that are in a different format, I recommend using a program such as VLC or Audacity to convert them to a WAV file.
